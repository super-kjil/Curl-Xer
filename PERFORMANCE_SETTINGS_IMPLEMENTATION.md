# Performance Settings Implementation

## Overview
The Performance Settings in the Domain Checker app have been fully implemented and are now functional. Users can now configure batch sizes and timeout values that will actually affect the URL checking process.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Updates (Settings.tsx)
- ✅ Removed `cursor-not-allowed` class from all performance setting inputs
- ✅ Added proper focus states and dark mode support
- ✅ All input fields are now fully interactive and editable

### 2. Backend Integration (DomainCheckerController.php)
- ✅ Added import for `DomainCheckerSetting` model
- ✅ Modified `checkUrls()` method to retrieve user's performance settings
- ✅ Updated logic to use user settings instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ Added logging to track which settings are being used
- ✅ Enhanced response to include settings that were used

### 3. Service Layer Updates (UrlCheckerService.php)
- ✅ Updated `checkURLsParallel()` method to accept `timeout` parameter
- ✅ Updated `checkURLsOptimized()` method to accept `timeout` parameter
- ✅ Modified `processBatchesConcurrently()` to pass timeout through the chain
- ✅ Enhanced `calculateOptimalBatchSize()` to use user settings
- ✅ Updated `estimateProcessingTime()` to use user's timeout setting
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded timeout values with dynamic parameters

### 4. Database Integration
- ✅ Performance settings are stored in `domain_checker_settings` table
- ✅ Settings are retrieved per user when processing URLs
- ✅ Default values are applied if no user settings exist

## How It Works Now

### Before (Hardcoded):
```php
// Old hardcoded approach
$batch_size = 100; // Always 100
$timeout = 30;     // Always 30 seconds
```

### After (User Configurable):
```php
// New dynamic approach
$userSettings = DomainCheckerSetting::where('user_id', Auth::id())->first();
$batch_size = $userSettings?->batch_size ?? 100;
$large_batch_size = $userSettings?->large_batch_size ?? 1000;
$timeout = $userSettings?->timeout ?? 30;
```

## Performance Settings Available

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Batch Size** | 1-1000 | 100 | URLs processed per batch for small sets |
| **Large URL Batch Size** | 500-2000 | 1000 | URLs processed per batch for 10,000+ URLs |
| **Timeout** | 5-120 seconds | 30 | Maximum time to wait for each URL response |

## Usage Examples

### Small URL Sets (< 10,000 URLs)
- Uses user's `batch_size` setting
- Processes URLs in parallel with user's timeout
- Example: 500 URLs with batch_size=200 = 3 batches

### Large URL Sets (≥ 10,000 URLs)
- Uses user's `large_batch_size` setting
- Processes URLs with optimized concurrency control
- Example: 50,000 URLs with large_batch_size=1500 = 34 batches

## Benefits

1. **Customizable Performance**: Users can tune the app based on their needs
2. **Better Resource Management**: Larger batch sizes for powerful servers, smaller for limited resources
3. **Flexible Timeouts**: Adjust timeout based on network conditions and server responsiveness
4. **User-Specific Settings**: Each user can have their own performance preferences
5. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly which settings were used for each check

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created (`PerformanceSettingsTest.php`) that verifies:
- ✅ Settings are saved and retrieved correctly
- ✅ Default values are applied when no settings exist
- ✅ Validation rules are enforced (min/max values)
- ✅ Settings are used in actual URL processing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Show actual processing times vs estimated
2. **Adaptive Settings**: Automatically adjust settings based on server performance
3. **Preset Configurations**: Quick-select configurations for different use cases
4. **Performance Analytics**: Track which settings work best for different scenarios

## Conclusion

The Performance Settings are now fully functional and provide users with real control over how the Domain Checker processes URLs. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding significant new functionality that will improve user experience and system performance.
